**TextEditor** is an early-stage educational project designed as a functional prototype of a basic Word-style text editor.

This project was developed collaboratively during the 6th month of programming education, focusing on implementing practical features commonly found in everyday text editors. Despite architectural imperfections and hardcoded areas, the project delivers a fully functional, interactive editing experience.

## üß© Technical Context

- Developed during the first practical exposure to GUI applications  
- Built with beginner-to-intermediate knowledge of UI frameworks  
- Partial hardcoding for interface elements and defaults  
- Lacks modern architectural separation (monolithic structure)  
- Focused primarily on delivering visible functionality  
- Served as a foundation for understanding:  
   - Event-driven programming  
   - File I/O for text and binary formats  
   - Working with rich text components  
   - User-centric feature development

## üí° Project Significance

**TextEditor** marks the first large-scale, team-based coding experience with real feature delivery under time constraints.

Although the codebase reflects early-stage development skills, the project demonstrates:

‚úî Ability to replicate complex UI behavior  
‚úî Handling user input and dynamic styling  
‚úî Integration of multiple editing tools into a unified interface  
‚úî Practical understanding of file operations and document manipulation  
‚úî Collaborative coding workflows within a small team
